// I decided to create a calculator that would give you the ideal tip for your service

var whatSalon = prompt("What Salon do you work in?");  // prompt to know what salon they are in
var cutCharge = prompt("How much do you charge for a haircut?"); // prompt to know how much they charge for a haircut
cutCharge = Number(cutCharge); // notifying that cutCharge is a numerical value
var blowDry = prompt("How much do you charge for a blowdry?"); // prompt to know how much they charge for a blowdry
blowDry = Number(blowDry); // notifying that blowDry is a numerical value
var salonCut = prompt("How much percent does " + whatSalon + " take out of your services?"); // prompt what cut the salon takes for your services
salonCut = Number(salonCut); // notifying that salonCut is a numercal value
salonCut = Math.round(salonCut)/100;



//Tip Variables
var tipPercent = [.1,.15,.2]; // array for tip percentages

//Haircut Tip Calculations
var cutTen = cutCharge * tipPercent[0];
var cutFifteen = cutCharge * tipPercent[1];
var cutTwenty = cutCharge * tipPercent[2];

//Blowdry Tip Calculations
var blowTen = blowDry * tipPercent[0];
var blowFifteen = blowDry * tipPercent[1];
var blowTwenty = blowDry * tipPercent[2];

//Haircut & Blowdry Totals
var hairTotal = cutCharge - (cutCharge * salonCut);
var blowTotal = blowDry - (blowDry * salonCut);





//Console logs
// console.log(salonCut); Tested to see if Math Round created a percentage amount in decimals.  Input 30 for prompt came out as 0.3 TEST COMPLETE.
