// I decided to create a calculator that would give you the ideal tip for your service while showing your earnings for the day.

var whatSalon = prompt("What Salon do you work in?");  // prompt to know what salon they are in

var cutTimes = prompt("How many haircuts did you have today?");
cutTimes = Number(cutTimes);
var cutCharge = prompt("How much do you charge for a haircut?"); // prompt to know how much they charge for a haircut
cutCharge = Number(cutCharge); // notifying that cutCharge is a numerical value

var salonCut = prompt("How much percent does " + whatSalon + " take out of your services?"); // prompt what cut the salon takes for your services
salonCut = Number(salonCut); // notifying that salonCut is a numercal value
salonCut = Math.round(salonCut)/100;
cutConsole = Math.round(salonCut * 100);

//Tip Variables
var tipPercent = [.1,.15,.2]; // array for tip percentages

//Haircut Tip Calculations
var cutTen = cutCharge * tipPercent[0];
var cutFifteen = cutCharge * tipPercent[1];
var cutTwenty = cutCharge * tipPercent[2];

//Haircut Totals
var hairTotal = cutCharge - (cutCharge * salonCut);

//Haircut earnings
var hairToday = cutTimes * hairTotal

//Full Totals
var fullHair0 = hairTotal;
var fullHair1 = hairTotal;
var fullHair2 = hairTotal;
  fullHair0 += cutTen;
  fullHair1 += cutFifteen;
  fullHair2 += cutTwenty;

//Console logs
console.log("Hey! Welcome to the Salon-culator");
console.log("You are working at " + whatSalon + " where they are taking out " + cutConsole + "% out of each service.");
console.log("You are currently charging $" + cutCharge +" for haircuts.");
console.log("An okay tip from a client after your haircut is $" + cutTen + "");
console.log("A decent tip from a client after your haircut is $" + cutFifteen + "");
console.log("A great tip from a client after your haircut is $" + cutTwenty + "");
console.log("Here are your total earnings after each haircut and depending on the tip:");
console.log("A 10% tip will give you $" + fullHair0 + ", a 15% tip will give you $" + fullHair1 + ", and a 20% tip will give you $" + fullHair2 + "");
console.log("You said you had " + cutTimes + " haircuts today giving you a total earnings of $" + hairToday + " no tips included!");
console.log("Have a good day!");
